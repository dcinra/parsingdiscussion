# parsingdiscussion
A project made with Java that parses the source code of a discussion forum into a xlsx-file. 
Created for a friend that needed to anaylyze the discussion data from ylilauta.org.
The project is pretty messy compared to just using API, but since I'm not familiar with it's workings I wanted to use what I already know.
